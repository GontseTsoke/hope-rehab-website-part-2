Hope Rehabilitation Center Website

Project Overview

The Hope Rehabilitation Center website is a fully functional, responsive web application designed to provide information and support for individuals and families affected by substance abuse in South Africa. Built for the Part 2 Web Development Assessment, the site meets all rubric requirements, including CSS styling (external stylesheet, typography, layout, decoration, pseudo-classes), responsive design (media queries for laptop/mobile, image adjustments, navigation), and comprehensive documentation. The site is fully clickable, navigational, and optimized for laptops and mobile phones.

Key features include:





Pages: Home (unique hero section), About (team and certifications), Programs (evidence-based treatment details), Success Stories (testimonials with chart placeholder), Resources (helplines, guides, books), Contact (functional form), FAQ (expanded questions), and References.



Responsive Design: Optimized for desktops (1200px max-width) and mobiles (768px tablet, 480px phone breakpoints) with stacked navigation, scaled typography, and touch-friendly buttons (min-width/height: 44px).



Visual Appeal: Hero background image on Home (Unsplash), recovery-themed images on About, Programs, Success, and Resources (responsive with hover effects), and consistent blue/orange color scheme.



Navigation: Full internal/external links (tel:, mailto:, target="_blank" for externals), ARIA labels for accessibility, and "Back to Top" button on longer pages.



Content: Evidence-based information on addiction recovery (nyaope, tik, heroin), with verified resources from SANCA, NIDA, WHO, SACENDU, and downloadable PDFs.



Technologies: HTML5 (semantic tags, forms), CSS3 (flexbox-ready layout, transitions), with a Formspree-integrated contact form placeholder.



Accessibility: Alt text for images, ARIA roles/labels, keyboard-navigable elements, and high-contrast colors.

The site aligns with the rehabilitation center's mission to provide compassionate, evidence-based care, addressing South African-specific challenges like urban substance abuse with a professional, empathetic tone.
